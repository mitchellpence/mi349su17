Potential Members
	Are you interested in Going Greek? There are many benefits to joining a fraternity, some more obvious than 
others. The best way to learn more about Greek Life is to participate in open rush. Rush is a three day period when 
all fraternities on campus welcome in prospective members to their house. During this time you will be able to meet 
the brothers, tour the house, and ask questions about what it means to be member. It is recommended that you visit 
multiple houses throughout rush week in order to find a place you feel most comfortable. If you have any questions 
regarding the rush process, feel free to contact our Recruitment Chair Patrick Grady.
